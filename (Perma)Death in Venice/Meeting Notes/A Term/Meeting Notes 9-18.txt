General game structure:
 Path is Aschenbach's strict lifestyle, nothing changes
 Loops through as he's experienced everything
 Tadzio sometimes overlaps, most of the time is off to the side
 Following Tadzio off the path will eventually lead back to the path
 The path will be in a worse state on returning
 If the player does not pursue Tadzio, they're going through the same motions every "day".
 Red guy can leave main path after being talked to (moving off it), spawn off the main path as well. Normal NPCs won't.
  IMPORTANT ISSUE: WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE PLAYERS WHO STAY ON THE MAIN PATH
  *force off the main path at some point
    *feels game-y
  *allow the player to remain on the main path indefinitely
   *eventually leave Venice, survive
    *yay good end you didn't die! Title becomes a misnomer
   *eventually still contract cholera, die
    *title remains intact, Tadzio pursuit ignored. Least intrusive, but also least satisfying.
 
 Other flashbacks/dreams are the same style and serve to establish characterization
 Possibly force off the path in the dream: just a gap so you must take the side paths
 The side paths will never rejoin there, however.
