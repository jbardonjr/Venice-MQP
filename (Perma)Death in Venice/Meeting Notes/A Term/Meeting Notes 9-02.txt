Planned agenda for Advisor meeting
Trello and BitBucket integrated into Slack
	BitBucket has a created repository, non-configured
	Trello has a board created, nothing is in it yet
	Will be going over BitBucket during meeting Thursday
Agenda e-mailed and posted to Slack
Map size discussed (tentative 320x320 bead map to start)
	Reasoning: about 10-20 screens per 'cycle', allows empty space to prevent the design from feeling constrained
