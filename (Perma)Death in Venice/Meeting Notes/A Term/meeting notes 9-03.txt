IRB form:
Project name is MQP name, not game name
Study protocol needs to be expanded substantially
	How do we find subjects, etc. (informal testing by friends/colleagues!!)
	What we are testing for (metrics, questions, etc.)
	At the end of testing subject will be given a survey (show survey)
Very important to be made clear that all tests are volunteers
Also that all subjects get a random number to be non-identifiable
Use standard consent form for test subjects

Is the IMGD Lab/another classroom considered a private room?

Setting up source control discussed

Intro to the game discussed
	Potentially wander around in a grey area for a while, last area visited has red guy
	Red may be a colorblind issue, see how people react to red in a grey area
	Clicking on the guy, dissolve to boat?
Avoid extensive dialogue

Articulate the experience goal
	Use the experience goal to trim the design down to only its essential components
	One or two sentences, describe the peak moments
	Figure out the ending
	Storyboard out the crucial scenes (including player actions!)
		Make sure these are implementable
	Based on the experience goal, determine when the player knows they can only play once
		Depending on what the goal is, let them know before/after
