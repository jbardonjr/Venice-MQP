IRB form feedback
	Form itself: fine
	Study Protocol: very much improved, could still use further generic questions (from Slack)

Next meeting:
Approval of IRB Approval
Finish the forms on Friday
Watch the movie on Monday (?)
Absolutely need to nail down the experience goal ASAP
	Probably focus on the flirtation/pursuit mechanics
	"Here are the emotions we hope to induce and here are the key moments towards that"
	describe a playthrough

Have NPCs spout lines to move the narrative along (in place of overt goals): external dialogue vs. internal monologue
