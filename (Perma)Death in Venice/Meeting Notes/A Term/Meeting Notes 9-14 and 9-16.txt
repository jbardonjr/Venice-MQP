14th:
We watched the Death in Venice movie.
There were a few discussions then, and then we parted to ruminate on what we observed and how it pertains to our game.
Aschenbach is an artist of some kind- perhaps the best kind is the one most relating to the medium?
Book: writer (words and prose)
Movie: composer (audio for ambience in a very show, don't tell format)
Game: perhaps a graphic artist of some sort (even more show, don't tell in the more limited space)

16th:
Went over Study Protocol questions to determine which questions could be cut down to 10-12.
Discussed experience goal
Key bullet points:
	Get the player to focus on fixation over self-preservation
	Aschenbach as artist for 'pursuit of art'
	Dream pulls out the rug by questioning the above (creepy lust or just art?)
When does player discover permadeath: beginning, end, or middle?
	End is most likely stronger than beginning.
	Middle, after the player has committed to the death IF it can be done without feeling shoehorned in would probably be the strongest.
The best point for the sickness to strike would likely be when the player feels most invested.
