IRB form filled out
	Major point of discussion was number of tests, came out with ~60 as a high or B Term under the following assumptions:
no testing week 1, or final week (final tweaks for testing/from testing)
Half hour maximum length per test
3 hours of testing, twice a week (gives time for changing based on feedback)
6 per day, 10 days, 60 people.

Testing protocol discussed (in more detail in the IRB form)
	In a broad sense: participants are observed playing the game, offer their thoughts after completion, are thanked for their time.
Potentially have the participants play the game multiple times, to see how the experience changes

Began work on game design document
Potential map/general AI implementation determined
Permadeath vs. Procedural Generation vs. both
	*Currently leaning towards just permadeath, procedural generation without replays wouldn't deliver on as solid of an experience as one hand crafted map.

Flow of scenes discussed

Potential start point of Germany (gray, contrast with Venice, relatively linear), arrive in Venice by boat, meet Tadzio, Tadzio behaviors during chase
